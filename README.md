# foundation-software-engineering
ðŸš† materials as a trainee in software engineering

Learned the fundamentals of software engineering course designed specifically for beginners with no prior coding knowledge

Learned core programming concepts and with the skillsets and know-how to solve complex problems by writing a sophisticated and efficient program

```js
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')({ sigint: true });


// main function
intro = () => {
    let nameUser = prompt('What is your name? ');
    console.log("Hey there " + nameUser.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + nameUser.slice(1) + "!\nLet 's play guessing game and try to guess a number in my mind. ");
    return guessGame();
}


guessGame = () => {
    // Random number from 1 - 100
    let numberInMind = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; // a number

    // This variable is used to determine if the app should continue prompting the user for input
    let foundCorrectNumber = false;

    let guess;

    while (!foundCorrectNumber) {

        // Step 1: Get user input (don't forget that the input is a string)


        guess = prompt("Now, I have a number. It is between 1-100, guess it? "); // a string

        //guess = Number(guess); // string to number?

        // Step 2: Compare the guess to the secret answer and
        // let the user know the feedback (too large, too small, correct).

        if (guess < 1 || guess > 100) {
            console.log("Between 1-100 only!");
        } else {
            if (guess === numberInMind) {
                foundCorrectNumber = true; // auto end game
                console.log("That's right. The number is " + numberInMind + ". You won!! ");
                return setReset();
            } else if (guess < numberInMind) {
                console.log("You guessed is too low. Guess again? ");
            } else if (guess > numberInMind) {
                console.log("You guessed is too high. Guess again? ");
            } else {
                console.log("No letter, number only!");
            }
        }
    }
}


setReset = () => {
    let foundCorrectNumber = false
    let proceed = prompt("New game or give up? (Y/N): ");

    while (!foundCorrectNumber) {
        if (proceed === "Y" || proceed === "y") {
            return intro();
        } else if (proceed === "N" || proceed === "n") {
            console.log("Bye.")
            break;
        } else {
            console.log("Yes(Y) or No(N)? ")
        }
    }
}



// start here
intro();
// Bonus Point: prompt user and provide option for user to start a new game after winning
