# About Me

In my development experience, I have worked on several projects that showcase my skills in web development and the frameworks I've used:

1. Food Ordering App: I developed a Food Ordering App using React as the main framework and employed the Context API for efficient state management. To enhance the user interface, I utilized Material UI, which allowed for a visually appealing design. Additionally, I integrated Cloudinary to enable seamless image upload functionality.

2. Find My News App: This web app makes use of the News API to fetch news data. To provide users with a personalized experience, I implemented LocalStorage for authentication, bookmarking, and Load More functionality. Additionally, I used dotenv for handling environment variables.

3. Contact Manager App: For this project, I utilized JSON Server for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on contact data. To achieve a modern and user-friendly interface, I employed Semantic UI. For efficient state management, I implemented the Context API, and for navigation, I used react-dom.

My skills in web development include proficiency in JavaScript (ES6), HTML, and CSS. I am well-versed in working with popular libraries and frameworks such as React, Material UI, Semantic UI, and Tailwind. In terms of tools and platforms, I have experience with version control using Git and Github, deployment on Netlify and Vercel, and working with REST APIs and GraphQL. For design purposes, I have utilized Figma and Canva.

Overall, I am a versatile web developer with experience in various aspects of web development, from frontend frameworks like React and Material UI to backend technologies such as JSON Server and REST APIs. I am confident in my ability to create efficient and visually appealing web applications using the latest web development tools and technologies.
