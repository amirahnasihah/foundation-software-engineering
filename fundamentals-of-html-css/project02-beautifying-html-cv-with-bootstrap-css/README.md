# Project 2: Beautifying an HTML CV with Bootstrap and CSS

## Part 1: Bootstrap Modeling

1. Sketch up a prototype for the structure and components you wish to add to your CV. You can just use pencil and paper to do the sketching.

2. A sample design for the template has been attached below. Note that you are encouraged not to copy the template directly but use it as a reference. Feel free to also look up for other CV templates from Google. ⬇️

3. Suggest including a header with a short background of yourself, contact information, followed by skills and experiences for the main body. But feel free to change to another structure you want.

## Part 2: Components

1.	Once you have an idea of the structure and what to include in the CV, explore the Bootstrap documentation website and select suitable components to create your CV template.

2.	A series of reference links for the components used in the template is provided below for reference. This is not the exhaustive list of components that you can use. You are also encouraged to use other components if needed. (For example, how to build a circular profile picture?)

| Components  | URL  |
|:-:|:-:|
| Navbar  | https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/navbar/  |
| Progress  | https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/progress/  |
| List Item  | https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/list-group/  |
| Table  | https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/content/tables/  |

## Part 3: Design and Responsiveness

1.	With the above structure and with the help of bootstrap components, convert the sketch mockup into a Bootstrap resume website.
2.	Ensure that the website is accessible to smaller screens such as mobile phones.
