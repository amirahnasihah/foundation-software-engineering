GRID GARDEN
Welcome to Grid Garden, where you write CSS code to grow your carrot garden! Water only the areas that have carrots by using the grid-column-start property.

For example, grid-column-start: 3; will water the area starting at the 3rd vertical grid line, which is another way of saying the 3rd vertical border from the left in the grid.
