# Flexbox

## justify-content



# align-items



## flex-direction

Help the frogs find their lilypads using flex-direction and justify-content.

Notice that when the flex direction is a column, justify-content changes to the vertical and align-items to the horizontal.

```css
#pond {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: row-reverse;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: flex-end;
}
```
