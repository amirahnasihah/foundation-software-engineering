## Setting up Selenium for Web Crawling

Context

In this project, we are going to build an automation script for crawling the data from TalentLabs website.
For automation, the most popular framework browser automation is “Selenium”. In this project, are going to set up selenium on the computer, then build a script trying to crawl the data from a website.

### Task 1 - Read about Selenium Library

Selenium library is a very useful tool for automating workflow on browser and webpages. Software engineers always us this to crawl data from the internet and automating their webpage testing. To get started with the project, please read about the selenium automation tool.

- Official Selenium Overview: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/overview/
- Official documentation: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/

### Task 2 - Setting up Selenium

After knowing what Selenium is, then we are going to setup Selenium with JavaScript. Please try to follow the step-by-step guide here:

If you have successfully completed the setup, you can then see that the code would open up a browser window and navigate to a website.


### Task 3 - Scraping the text from one of the website pages

After we are able to use Selenium, then the next step would be trying to scrap the text from our website.
Please pick one of the pages from the website, say “https://www.talentlabs.org/m1-modules/sql”. Then update the code based on the tutorial here:
https://smartproxy.com/what-is-web-scraping/selenium-scraping-with-node-js

Using selenium, you can use CSS path, CSS classname or CSS ID to select elements, and print out the text inside the elements. The goal here is to print out all the text content from the page you selected.

In this step, it is expected to be a bit complicated and also quite some trial-and-error. Might need to do some more Googling on “selenium nodejs web scraping”.
